September this year is dedicated to reviewing software architecture books.
This time, Iâ€™ve read [Building Evolutionary Architectures](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-evolutionary-architectures/9781492097532/) written by [Neal Ford](https://nealford.com).
I appreciate the effort put into compiling this book.
However, I found it to be more of a collection of existing books, articles and talks rather than offering new, original insights.

Below is my brief summary of the book:

* **Rapid Business Evolution**: The pace of business change is accelerating, necessitating that software systems keep up. Proper architecture is crucial for enabling software evolution.
* **Embracing Incremental Changes**: Software engineers can't predict unknown unknowns. By embracing incremental changes to test hypotheses, similar to evolutionary processes, failed experiments are discarded while successful ones are retained.
* **Short Release Cycles**: Release cycles must be short. There is no time for manual, repetitive tasks; therefore, everything must be automated.
