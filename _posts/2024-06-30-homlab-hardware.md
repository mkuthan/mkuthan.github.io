## Vision and Initial Requirements

When I started building my first homelab, I needed some vision and initial requirements to avoid costly mistakes. I meticulously researched hardware options, software configurations, and scalability considerations. As I laid the foundation for my homelab, I envisioned a versatile environment that would serve both my personal projects and professional development. This foresight allowed me to make informed decisions, optimize my setup, and create a robust infrastructure that continues to evolve.

### Network

* Centrally managed network devices to avoid manual and repetitive tasks.
* Dedicated network devices, networks must work if the server is down.
* [Category 6 ethernet cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_6_cable), to allow easily upgrades up to [10GBASE-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet#10GBASE-T).
* [Gigabit ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet#1000BASE-T) network devices to strike a balance between performance and affordability.
* [Wi-Fi 802.11ax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6) to utilize Gigabit network. [Mesh technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network) to extend coverage by creating a seamless network across my home and surroundings.
* [Power over Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet) to simplify the deployment of Wi-Fi access points, IP cameras, and other network devices. With PoE, you can transmit both data and power over a single Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for separate power sources.

### Server

* Power efficient to keep electricity costs under control.
* Multi-core CPU with high clock speeds and enough memory to handle all my virtual machines.
* GPU for hardware accelerated vision inference.
* NVMe SSD disk for OS hosting to get lightning-fast read and write speeds.
* Enterprise grade SATA disk for virtual machines to achieve reliability, durability, consistent performance, and avoid quick disk wear.
* USB3 to connect external HDD storage for camera recordings and backups.

### Cameras

* IP cameras with [RTSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Streaming_Protocol) for wide compatibility with various recording and monitoring systems.
* Can operate without internet access. The last thing I would want is for the cameras to have access to the internet.
* Decent image quality. Fixed length, 8Mpx/4Mpx with at least 1/3 CMOS image sensor.
* IR illumination to get night vision.
* H.265 codec to get better video quality at given bitrate compared to older codes like H.264.
* Minimal ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù features. Rely on open-source software for recording and detection, and avoid paying extra for features like facial recognition or cloud-based analytics.

### IoT

* Don't overengineer smart home, everything should enhance the user experience, not complicate it. Essential functionalities must work if the server is down.
* Base on [ZigBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee) mesh network, to avoid vendor specific Wi-Fi solutions.
* Wi-Fi devices only if there are no ZigBee viable alternatives. They have to work in a local network without cloud access and integrate well with Home Assistant.

### Other parts

* 19'' rack as organized space for mounting your network equipment, servers, and other devices.
* Patch panel for neatly organized Ethernet cables. It allows me to connect devices to the network without messy cable runs.
* Small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to ensure uninterrupted power supply during short electricity outages or fluctuations. Compatible with open-source software for monitoring and control.

## Big picture

I initiated the setup of my Homelab by meticulously planning the computer network, but the end result resembled a tangle of cables emerging from the walls in the utility room.
