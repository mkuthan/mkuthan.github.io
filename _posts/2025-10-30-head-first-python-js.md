A few months ago, my 13-year-old son and I were discussing his future high school options.
He's really smart and interested in technology (programming, robotics, 3D printing, etc.) but extremely bored with traditional school subjects.
Finding a school that would fit his interests wasn't easy, but fortunately my old friend *OrÅ‚oÅ›* told me about [TechniSchools](https://technischools.com/).

After some deep research, we discovered that *TechniSchools* is a perfect match for him.
My son decided to apply next year, but first he needs to do some serious homework in programming and other technical subjects.
He already knows *Scratch* and a bit of *C* (*Arduino*), *Python*, and *MicroPython* (*Lego Mindstorms*), but I suggested he should learn web technologies as well (*HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript*).

He started with [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) video tutorials, switched to VS Code with some Copilot help, and created a few simple web pages.
It was his way of learning by doingâ€”typical for his generation, I assume.

But recently he asked me to recommend some books ðŸ“š that would help him understand programming concepts better.
I was super happy ðŸ˜Š because **I know that reading books is the best way to learn programming fundamentals deeply**.

I started searching for books, but most of them were... just boring ðŸ˜´ (at least for a teenager).
Then I remembered the *Head First* series from O'Reilly.

My son started with *Head First JavaScript* and I started leafing through *Head First Python*.
First, you read about learning psychology and why these books are a bit different from typical programming books: lots of pictures, funny stories, quizzes, exercises, etc.
Then you dive into the project-based learning approach, building simple applications step by step.
In the JavaScript book, you create a ship battle game; in the Python book, you build a web app for swimming club training management.
I'm really impressed by how cleverly the books smuggle in programming concepts and best practices I usually apply in my daily work as a software engineer.
For example: make small iterations, prefer readability over cleverness, or apply the YAGNI principle.

Dear parents, I highly recommend these books for your kids interested in programming!
