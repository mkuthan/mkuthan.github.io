## Books

[Domain Driven Design](https:///show/179133.Domain_Driven_Designwww.goodreads.com/book) by Eric Evans. 

You have to read this book, period. From the very beginning to very end. 
Don't stop reading after first part of the book, the part about strategic design is much more important.
Study this book again and again. I didn't read this book at once, it would be impossible mission. 
Every time I back to this book I found something new, every single word in this book is important and brings some meaning.

[Implementing Domain Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15756865-implementing-domain-driven-design) by Vaughn Vernon.

More practical and easier to digest book than previous one. Not so brilliant but still worth reading.

[Exploring CQRS and Event Sourcing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19086899-exploring-cqrs-and-event-sourcing)

Excellent DDD/CQRS case study with working code on GitHub. 
Real world example how to define bounded context and how to integrate them using domain events.
Awesome!

[Enterprise Patterns and MDA](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434826.Enterprise_Patterns_and_MDA) by Jim Arlow and Ila Neusandt

Don't reinvent the wheel when you discover your domain model. At least for e-commerce :-) 
Apply presented archetype patterns wisely and save your ass.
