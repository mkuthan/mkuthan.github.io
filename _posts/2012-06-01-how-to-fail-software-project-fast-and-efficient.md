The short list based on excellent Thomas Sundberg [presentation](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/presentations2012/41presentation.pdf).

> Divide the team into separate divisions - analysis, architecture, development, operations, test, etc.

Make the communication as hard as possible, different locations, different managers, different cost centres etc.

> Assign developer to multiple projects managed by different people

Developers will be able to set priorities by themselves. 

Context switching is cheap.

> Everything should be written

You can always use written document as a evidence, even if it is not valid anymore.

> Don't allow to communicate development team with customers / end user

Developers are only for writing code based on given specifications.

> Separate Devs and Ops

Devs should not be allowed into the production system, they can break something. 

Ops do not have to know anything about systems they care.

> Improvement

No courses, no books, no conferences and learn only on personal time.

If you train them, they leave.

> Measuring

Number of fixes per day.
 
Less than 100% test code coverage is a failure.
 
100% Javadoc over descriptive naming, etc.

> Resources

Resources can be easily replaced, it does not matter that valuable employees have left.
 
We easily find next resource.

> Meetings

Schedule lots of them, demand everyone to be present, cancel them late or don't show up or be unprepared.

Always prepare meeting minutes.

> Planning

The most experienced person does it better than whole team.

Don't allow self-organization, only command and control\!

> Demotivation

Don't invest in tools, no large screens. 

The fastest laptops for managers (powerpoint slides are very heavy).

> Working offsite

Make it extremely difficult to work from home.

> Deployments

Avoid it, that's risky. 

Always manual, no more than twice a year. 

Different scenarios and teams for DEV, UAT and PROD.

> Failed builds

Who cares, it works on production.

Check-in new changes if the build is red.

> Company policies

Single tool/library/framework/platform for all.

> Architecture

Only "ivory tower" architects, at least 20.

> Testing

Load and performance tests on the end.

Only manual functional tests.
