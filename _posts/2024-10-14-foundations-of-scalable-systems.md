[Foundations of scalable systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/) written by [Ian Gorton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gortonator/), the book with my highest rate of 5 ⭐️!
I highly recommend that every software engineer grasps the distributed system principles outlined in this book.

**Clear and Structured Approach**: The book explains complex principles in a clear and organized manner.

**Wide Knowledge Coverage**: It provides a broad overview rather than deep dives into specific topics.

**Excellent References**: The book includes many references to whitepapers, books, articles, and websites for further reading.
