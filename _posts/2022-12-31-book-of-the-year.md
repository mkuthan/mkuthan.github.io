This is a first time when I've decided to select the best book of the year.
What were the evaluation criteria when I rated the book?

* Must greatly enhance my current software engineering skills
* Must give me a motivation for further experimentation and growth
* It should provide future-proof knowledge, even if the technology are passing away 

Cons:

* Language quirks: "after mobile feature was shoehorned into a hairball of code written primarily for server"
* Many authors with different writing styles
* A lot of duplication between chapters
