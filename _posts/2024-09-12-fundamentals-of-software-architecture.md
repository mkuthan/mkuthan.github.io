Recently I've read [Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/)
written by [Mark Richards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markrichards3/)
and [Neal Ford](https://nealford.com).
I found this book valuable, even though my company doesn't have a formal architect role.
At Allegro, the most experienced senior software engineers take on the responsibilities of a software architect in addition to their regular development duties.

At the end of the book, there is a self-assessment section, which I summarized by writing my answers in this blog post.
