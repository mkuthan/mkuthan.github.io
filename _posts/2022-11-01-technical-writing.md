I've managed this blog since 2011.
I'm also a primary contributor to the documentation managed by my team.
For example: on-boarding guide for new colleagues or a [tourist](https://blog.allegro.tech/2019/10/team-tourism-case-studies-1.html),
technical guides, definition of done, [architecture decision records](https://adr.github.io) and more.
As you perhaps already know, software engineers don't like writing technical documentation.
And as you also know, high quality documentation has tremendous benefits for engineering team or organization.

Today, I would like to share my experiences how to choose appropriate tools for writing better documentation.

## Documentation as a code

Documentation as a code is a key enabler for all tools and practices presented in this blog post.
It enables the culture where developers take ownership of documentation.
With documentation as a code culture, developers:

* Write documentation with the same tools and processes they use for development.
* Keep the documentation in the source code repository, close to the code.
* Write and refactor code and documentation together.
* Apply best practices like code review or pair programming.
* Automate documentation tests and deployments.

I used to write documentation using [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) Wiki platform. Regardless of efforts, the documentation was always rusty.

## Markup language selection

Use whatever plain text markup you like: Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, DocBook or LaTeX.
Check only, if the format meets the following criteria:

* Must be readable using plain text editor.
How to make a code review for binary formats?
* Must be portable without worrying about compatibility.
It's likely that you will change the publication platform several times during documentation life.
* Must separate the content and its formatting.
Writer should focus on content and semantic not on look and feel.
* Should be easy to learn, and forgive syntax mistakes.
* Should be widely supported by developers tools.

I used to write documentation using Latex and DocBook.
For the last 10 years I've been using Markdown.

## Markdown into static website conversion

Markdown is perfect for a single README, but how to build documentation consists of many pages?
Some parser must convert bunch of Markdown files into a beautiful website.

Again, use whatever converter you like but check if the following capabilities exist for generated website:

* Website navigation, you must be able to see website structure and navigate between pages.
* Many themes, you expect different layout for documentation website and blog post.
* Table of contents, it simplifies navigation for complex pages.
* Search capabilities, documentation without search isn't so useful.

Because you are writing technical documentation look also for:

* Code syntax highlighting for many popular programming languages like [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) or 
[Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma).
* Diagrams and visualizations like [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) or [yuml](https://yuml.me)
* Math expressions like [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org)

At the time of writing my favorite Markdown converter is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) but I would also like to check [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

With Jekyll you can serve your website locally using the following command:

```shell
$ jekyll serve --livereload
Configuration file: /Users/marcin/tmp/site/my-new-site/_config.yml
            Source: /Users/marcin/tmp/site/my-new-site
       Destination: /Users/marcin/tmp/site/my-new-site/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
       Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
                    done in 0.404 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/marcin/tmp/site/my-new-site'
LiveReload address: http://127.0.0.1:35729
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Every edit re-generates pages for modified files and reloads web browser.
Very convenient way of writing documentation, you continuously observe the results of editing.

For my personal blog I use [minimal-mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme.
Advertised as "perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio."
Look at <https://github.com/mkuthan/mkuthan.github.io> repository if you want to know,
how to get minimal but still fully functional blog posts website like mine ðŸ˜€

For technical documentation I prefer [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme.
