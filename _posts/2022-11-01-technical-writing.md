I've managed this blog since 2011. 
I'm also a primary contributor to the documentation managed by my team. 
For example: on-boarding guide, technical guides, definition of ready, definition of done, architecture decision records and more. 
As you perhaps already know, software engineers don't really like writing documentation.
Today, I would like to share my experiences how to make their lives a little bit easier.
