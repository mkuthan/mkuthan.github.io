[Foundations of scalable systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/foundations-of-scalable/9781098106058/) written by [Ian Gorton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gortonator/), the book with my highest rate of 5 ⭐️
I highly recommend that every software engineer grasps the distributed system principles outlined in this book.

You can say that this is a book about the basics, but these basics concern the construction of distributed systems, which isn’t an easy subject.
For less experienced engineers, this book reduces the area of unknown unknowns, turning them into known unknowns.
A lot of references allow them to deepen their knowledge as needed.
Experienced engineers can treat this book as a refresher and identify areas where they need to supplement their knowledge.

My general observations during the lecture:

**Clear and Structured Approach**: The book explains complex principles in a clear and organized manner.

**Wide Knowledge Coverage**: It provides a broad overview rather than deep dives into specific topics.

**Excellent References**: The book includes many references to whitepapers, books, articles, and websites for further reading.
