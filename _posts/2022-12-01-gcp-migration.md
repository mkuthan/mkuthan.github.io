Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## IT procurement

> Cloud platforms contain hundreds of individual products, making a comparison rather meaningless.
> Better approach is to compare your company's vision with the provider's product strategy.

Why Allegro migrated on-premise big data pipelines to GCP?

* Machine learning (ML) for everyone
* Scalability
* No scoring or cloud matrix comparison
* TODO

> In the case of cloud, you're not looking to replace an existing component that serves a specific organizational need.
> Rather the opposite, you're looking for a product that enables your organization to work in fundamentally different way.

Allegro adjusted it's operating model to Google Cloud Platform.
On-premise Hadoop cluster hasn't been replaced by something similar in cloud.

* BigQuery isn't a Hive / HDFS / Parquet replacement, it enables TODO
* Dataproc / ephemeral clusters / Spark on K8S / etc.
* Dataflow - unified batch and streaming
* Vertex AI - TODO: ask Maciek how it has change the way they're working
* TODO

> Traditional IT budgets are set up at least a year in advance, making the predictability a key consideration.
> IT procurement tends to negotiate multiyear license terms for the software they buy.

* Cloud elastic pricing turns Allegro procurement upside down.
* TODO

## TODO

> You shouldn't run software that you didn't build

TODO

> If something breaks, you're guilty until proven innocent

TODO

> I attempted a couple of small migrations with highly motivated teams but without a program manager. They achieved their objectives, but with participant burnout and huge cost and time overruns.

TODO

> Automation and federation to achieve even faster migration velocity.

TODO

> Your metrics will evolve over time along with your migration, transitioning from technical metrics to business relevant value-oriented metrics.

TODO

> For most enterprises, a hybrid-cloud scenario is inevitable (...) have a good plan for how to make the best use of it.
> Five multi-cloud scenarios: arbitrary, segmented, choice, parallel, portable.

TODO

> If you want to achieve true hybrid-cloud setup (...) uniform management and deployment across the environments.

TODO

> Most failure scenarios break the abstraction.

TODO

> Excessive complexity is nature's punishment for organizations that are unable to make decisions.

TODO

> The most subtle and most dangerous type of lock-in is the one that affects your thinking.

TODO

> Technology Radar designated "Generic Cloud Usage" as Hold already in late 2018.

TODO

> Cloud and automation add a new "ility": disposability.

TODO

> Docker was designed and built for developers, not operations staff.

TODO

> Five characteristic of Cloud-Ready applications: Frugal, Relocatable, Observable, Seamlessly updatable, internally Secured, failure Tolerant (FROSST).

TODO

> A cloud journey isn't a one-time shot, but an ongoing series of learning and optimization.

TODO

> In the cloud, your biggest levers are sizing and resource lifetime.

`Costs [$] = size[units] * time[hours] * unit costs[$/unit/hour]`

What about DEV/TEST?

TODO

> Exchange rate

TODO

> The most expensive server is the one that’s not doing anything. Even at a 30% discount.

TODO

> Shifting from robustness and redundancy to resilience and automation is one of several ways how the cloud can defy existing contradictions, such as providing better uptime at lower cost.

TODO

> You might be surprised that changing providers wasn't on the list of major savings vehicles.

TODO

> If your data is largely static, you can save a lot in pay-per-query model by creating interim results tables.

TODO

> Knowing your needs and usage patterns is the most important ingredient into reducing costs.

TODO

> When comparing prices, don't expect huge difference in pricing between providers -- open market competition is doing its job just fine.

TODO

> Discount negotiations

TODO

> Lowering costs but making them visible in the process can be perceived as "costing more" by your internal customers.

TODO

> Deprecation allocates capital expenses spread over a period of time.

TODO

> Monitoring cost should be a standard element of any cloud operation, just like monitoring for traffic and memory usage.

TODO

> Unfortunately, many enterprise cloud deployments detach developers from billing and payments.

TODO

> You want to encourage developers to build dynamic solutions that auto-scale, so the chances that you’re going to see some surprises on your bill are high enough that it’s wise to just allocate that money up front.

Tuition - special money for learning from mistakes.

TODO

> Overreacting isn't a good idea (...) the cloud is there to give developers more freedom and more control.

TODO

> Use free trials to try things instead of overcommitting.
