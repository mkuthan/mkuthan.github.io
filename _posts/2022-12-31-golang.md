# What I like

* Enforced, standard formatter
* Linter `golint`, `go vet`
* Unused variables cause compilation error
* Visual Studio Code
* Explicit type conversions
* Functions are first class citizen, functions are values
* Anonymous functions
* Closures  
* Efficient memory management (stack if possible instead of heap)
* Efficient 'Reader' interface 
* Call by-value but sometimes value is a pointer
* Methods on uninitialized (`nil`) instances  
* Safe pointers
* Goroutines, channels, mutexes as the last resort
* Race checker  
* Performance benchmark `25  47201025 ns/op  65342 B/op  65208 allocs/op`
* Testing, table tests, httptest
* Code coverage  
* Package cycle analysis
* Playground
* Single binary distribution
* Package/modules management
* Pinned dependency versions  (`go.sum`)
* Minimal version selection strategy  
* Multiple return values
* `_` for unused variables
* Generics
* `defer` for cleaning up resources in-place
* Embedding/composition
* Type-safe duck typing
* Context together with decorator pattern
* Dependency injection without any framework
* Clock and monotonic time
* Support for JSON
* Built-in HTTP2 server

# What I don't like

* Missing functional programming fluent API
* Mutable structures
* Unusual types, for example `complex64` or `complex128`
* Platform dependant types, for example `int`
* Byte operations on String type, `rune\int32` type 
* No free plugin in IntelliJ
* Makefiles
* Limited constants
* Arrays are not what do you think.
  Size of array is a part of the type and needs to be known at compile time.
* Limited collection types: arrays, slices and maps  


# Where I don't have an opinion yet

* Error handling
* Two ways for declaring variables: `var x = 10` vs. `x := 10` 
* Slices, passing to functions (length, capacity)
* Pointers, nil, dereferences
* Missing polymorphism
* Panic and recover - magic
* Reflect and unsafe
